# flashcard-app

I worked on this project with the intention of practicing and expanding my frontend skills in general.

This project could also be used as a tool to self-study on any topics, similar to real life flashcard.



This project includes:

-List of decks

-List of cards

-Customizable front/back cards

-A simplistic study function



Built using Javascript, ReactJS, Bootstrap4 and HTML.



Future goal:

-Add a randomization to the study function so cards will show up in random order.
